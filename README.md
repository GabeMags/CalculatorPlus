# CalculatorPlus
CPSC 362 Group 8's Calculator but with additional fun features

The main python file is responsible for the splash screen and the mode selection.

The kids calculator mode is a standalone application that is tracked by the main app.

The standard calculator mode has been abandoned in favor of the other two modes.
